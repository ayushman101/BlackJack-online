# BlackJack-online
Created in January of 2022.
My first project learning JS. Its a simple blackjack game built using html, css and javascript.
In a game of Blackjack the player draws cards one by one from a deck of cards.
The player wins if the sum of all the cards he drew is equal to 21.
If the sum is goes beyond 21 then player is out of game.
If the sum is still less than 21 the player can choose to draw again.
